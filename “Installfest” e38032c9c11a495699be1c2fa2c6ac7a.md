# ‚ÄúInstallfest‚Äù

# Overview:

Hello SEIR 725 - Welcome! We are so excited to meet you all and to work with you over the next 12+ weeks.  

To get the most out of our time together and to get you up-to-speed faster, *we will be rolling out our instruction a few days early*. **Before class on Day 1 you will install a few key pieces of software by following a self-paced guide for setting up your ‚Äòdeveloper environment.‚Äô**  

These tools will be used throughout the cohort and will be required for turning in future deliverables, writing and testing your code, as well as *optimizing* your life as a developer.  

These tools are broken down into the following categories: 

**Learning Aids:** 

- Zoom
- Slack
- Notion

**Developer Tools:** 

- VSCode
- zsh (terminal shell)
- Git
- NodeJS
- Xcode (Mac Only)

**Quality-of-Life Tools :** 

- These will vary, depending on your OS / platform, but may include workspace managers, password storage tools, keyboard short-cuts.

## Instructions:

1. Select the link below that corresponds to your computer system‚Äôs hardware/configuration 
2. Read through the document thoroughly before you start implementing any instructions
3. Read through it a second time and take notes of new technical terms.
4. Take a deep breath, **you‚Äôve got this!** üí™
5. Follow the instructions according to the letter (see the special notes below) 
6. If you are ‚Äúblocked‚Äù during installation (i.e. you encounter an error), make a note of where you left off and be prepared to provide a status update in class on Day 1.  If you are able to move ahead - Great! **You will receive troubleshooting support from your instructional team on Day 1 after orientation.** 
7. Do your best, go as far as you can, everyone has different comfort levels with technology. **Be patient with yourself, especially if this content is brand new.** 
8. If you finish all of your Day 1 instructions, you may begin the Unit 2 / Unit 3 instructions. 
*Note: Instructional support on Day 1 will focus on the Day 1 materials.*  

## Due Date:

Try to have all Day 1 instructions by the beginning of class on July 25th, 2022. 

## Special Notes:

### It is so important that you follow all of these instructions to a T, **without skipping ahead**. 

It is also very important, when working in the terminal, to ensure that you type everything exactly correctly before running the command. 

You are interacting with your computer's inner configurations, and each command should be treated with care and intention.
