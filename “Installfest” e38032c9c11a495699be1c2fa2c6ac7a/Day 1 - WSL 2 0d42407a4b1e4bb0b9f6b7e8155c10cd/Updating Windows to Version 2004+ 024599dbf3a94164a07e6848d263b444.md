Some devices may not currently be eligible for Windows 10 version 2004. If this occurs on your device an error like the one to the right will appear. 

If this is the case for your machine, ***it will not be able to run WSL 2*** (at least until Microsoft determines your machine is compatible with the update)*.* **Running a Linux variant will be a better option in your circumstance.**
