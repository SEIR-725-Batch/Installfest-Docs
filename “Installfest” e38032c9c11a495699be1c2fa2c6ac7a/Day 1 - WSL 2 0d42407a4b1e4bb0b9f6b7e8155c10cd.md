# Day 1 - WSL 2

![Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/rxil8c3o.bmp](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/rxil8c3o.bmp)

<aside>
üö® WSL 2 is relatively new, and potentially buggy. It is still under very active development. If you are uncomfortable with configuring and troubleshooting Windows and Linux, this may not be a good solution for you.

# What You Need to Begin *(YOU MUST READ THIS DO NOT SKIP THIS SECTION THIS IS IMPORTANT)*

- ***A device running Windows 10 updated to version 2004, build 19041 or greater. WSL 2 WILL NOT RUN on versions before this. You MUST update Windows to be on version 2004, build 19041 or greater to continue! Check out*** [Updating Windows to Version 2004+](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Updating%20Windows%20to%20Version%202004+%20024599dbf3a94164a07e6848d263b444.md)
- A familiarity with your system's BIOS may be required. This is extremely important as you may need to adjust BIOS settings to complete the WSL install, particularly if your machine uses an AMD processor. You are not able to screen share within the BIOS environment and it will be different depending on the device you use. Therefore, it is ON YOU to be able to enter this environment and find the settings you will need to change. ***Modifying the incorrect settings in the BIOS can cause permanent hardware damage to your device, which we are not liable for. IF THIS SCARES YOU, WSL may not be the best option for you.***
- A non-Windows 10 S Version of Windows 10
- A user account with administrative privilege to your local installation of Windows 10.
- A Microsoft Account with access to the Microsoft Store application. (All requirements are free, but are only available from the Microsoft Store)
- At least 25GB of free hard drive space
- At least 8GB of RAM (more is GREATLY preferable)
- A modern processor capable of running virtual environments - specifically processors with Intel Virtualization Technology (Intel VT) or AMD Virtualization (AMD-V) technology
- A fundamental understanding of Windows and Linux system administration and debugging.

# Troubleshooting

If you run into issues during this process Microsoft has a collection of errors and their suggested fixes [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#troubleshooting-installation) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting#common-issues). If your issue is not included in that documentation you can also search for your specific error on the [WSL GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/wsl/issues?q=) page. If you've exhausted those resources try searching Google. If your issue remains unresolved reach out to an instructor for further guidance.

<aside>
‚ùó Be prepared for there to not currently be a fix for your problem.

> 

Among its many useful tools, PowerToys includes one of the best window managers: FancyZones - which allows you to customize window layouts and get the best setup just for you. 

Get PowerToys [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/). 

# A Note On Copying Commands

When possible, ***please copy the commands from this page***. You will use most of the commands here once and never again. Typing them out will only introduce the possibility for you to make errors. Certain commands will require you to alter portions of them - this is specifically called out when they appear. There are no bonus points for doing work that has already been done for you.

# Run Windows PowerShell as Administrator.

Use **Windows Logo Key + R** on your keyboard, type `powershell`, and use **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** on your keyboard to run as administrator.

![PowerShell running with administrative access. Note the title bar!](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%202.png)

PowerShell running with administrative access. Note the title bar!

Use this command to enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux:

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```

Use this command to enable the Virtual Machine Platform:

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

Save any work you want to keep, including this page.

# Restart your computer.

Restart your computer to continue!

# Run Windows PowerShell as administrator.

Use `Windows Logo Key + r` on your keyboard, type `powershell`, and use `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` on your keyboard to run as administrator.

Use this command to set WSL 2 as the default WSL version:

```powershell
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

<aside>
üö® You might see this message after running that command: 
`WSL 2 requires an update to its kernel component. For information please visit https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel`
Follow [this link](https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel). Download the latest WSL2 Linux kernel from the page and install it.

Run the `wsl --set-default-version 2` command again after the install is completed. The message should not appear.

</aside>

# Install Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store

Follow [this link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu-2004-lts/9n6svws3rx71) to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on the Microsoft Store. Select the `Get` button which will launch the Microsoft Store application. Select the `Get` button again on the page inside the Microsoft Store application.

![Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on the Microsoft Store](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%203.png)

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on the Microsoft Store

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS will install and can then be started by selecting the `Launch` button.

![Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%204.png](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%204.png)

Ubuntu will then finalize the installation, which may take a few minutes. You will then be prompted to create a username and password. The password will not be visible as you type it. It is ***extremely important*** that you do not forget this username and password - preferably you will store it an a password manager such as [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) or [1Password](https://1password.com/). 

![Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%205.png](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%205.png)

<aside>
üéä You're now running WSL 2! Congrats! But don't close this window you're not quite done yet...

</aside>

# Launching Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

To re-launch Ubuntu 20.04 LTS press `Windows Logo Key + r`, enter `ubuntu2004`, and select `OK`

# Updating and Upgrading Packages

Windows **does not** manage your Linux installation and will not automatically perform updates. To manually do this use this command:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

![Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%206.png](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%206.png)

Do this now. Enter your password when prompted, and accept changes to be made.

Also run this command to ensure you have wget (to retrieve content from web servers) and ca-certificates (to ensure SSL-based apps can check the authenticity of the connections they make):

```bash
sudo apt-get install wget ca-certificates
```

You may get notifications that these are already installed. If so, great.

# zsh

zsh is the shell of taste and class. Install it with this command:

```bash
sudo apt install zsh
```

Verify the installation with this command:

```bash
zsh --version
```

The version number should be 5.4.2 or greater

Make zsh the default shell with this command. Enter your Linux password when prompted.

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Close Ubuntu with this command:

```bash
logout
```

Launch Ubuntu again by pressing `Windows Logo Key + r` on your keyboard, entering `ubuntu2004`, and selecting OK.

Ubuntu will launch and likely present you with this screen:

![The zsh-newuser-install function running. Enter `2` for a default configuration.](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%207.png)

The zsh-newuser-install function running. Enter `2` for a default configuration.

Your terminal likely looks different now!

![zsh in action](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%208.png)

zsh in action

but to confirm it worked we can use this command:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

This should return `/usr/bin/zsh`.

Finally, just to be extra sure use this command:

```bash
$SHELL --version
```

This should return the same version number as the `zsh --version` command you ran earlier.

# Oh My Zsh

We're also going to install Oh My Zsh - an "open-source, community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration." Use this command:

```bash
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

![The result!](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%209.png)

The result!

The vanilla configuration of Oh My Zsh is great for our needs, but you can further customize it if you want to - check out [their website](https://ohmyz.sh/) and [their documentation](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki) to see how.

# Visual Studio Code

If you have not installed Visual Studio Code from [the Visual Studio Code site](https://code.visualstudio.com/) do so now. Install Visual Studio Code on Windows - not in the WSL file system.

<aside>
‚ùó When prompted to `Select Additional Tasks` during installation, be sure to check the `Add to PATH` option so you can easily open a folder in WSL using the `code` command.

</aside>

## Install the Remote WSL extension

Once VS Code is installed continue by Installing the [Remote - WSL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) in Visual Studio Code.

**Microsoft has this to say about running extensions on WSL:**

> The Remote-WSL extension splits VS Code into a ‚Äúclient-server‚Äù architecture, with the client (the user interface) running on your Windows machine and the server (your code, Git, plugins, etc) running remotely.

When running VS Code Remote, selecting the 'Extensions' tab will display a list of extensions split between your local machine and your WSL distribution.

Installing a local extension, like a theme, only needs to be installed once.

Some extensions, like the Python extension or anything that handles things like linting or debugging, must be installed separately on each remote WSL distribution. VS Code will display a warning icon ‚ö†, along with a green "Install in WSL" button, if you have an extension locally installed that is not installed on your WSL Remote.
> 

<aside>
‚ùó This concept is **VERY IMPORTANT.** You are now running two separate operating systems simultaneously on your machine. When something is installed in one operating system, the other will not know about it! Let's explore this concept more.

</aside>

# Git in Windows 10

If you don't already have Git installed in Windows 10 do that now from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

<aside>
üí° While you could use git on Windows as a source control manager, we won't be for our purposes - instead we will be using it mainly for it's credential management features. Unless you have a specific need for the features unchecked it's recommended you use only install the checked components below:

</aside>

***Do not change the install location.***

You will be given many prompts on features to install and choices to make while installing Git. All of these may be left as their default, except for the ones below.

![Note we have unchecked some features not required for our purposes that may only be confusing or get in the way.](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%2010.png)

Note we have unchecked some features not required for our purposes that may only be confusing or get in the way.

When prompted, you should select Use Visual Studio Code as Git's default editor. 

![Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%2011.png](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%2011.png)

![Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/image_(12).png](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/image_(12).png)

Also ensure that you are using Git Credential Manager Core

![Use the Git Credential Manager Core ](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/image_(27).png)

Use the Git Credential Manager Core 

All other settings may be left as their default.

# Git in Ubuntu

Git comes pre-installed with Ubuntu, but ensure you have the most recent stable version with:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
```

When prompted, press `Enter`

Then enter:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

and

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

Add your GitHub username, email, and password to your git configuration:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Username"
```

Replace `Username` with your name. Ensure you leave the quotes surrounding your username.

```bash
git config --global user.email "user@email.com"
```

Replace `user@email.com` with the email address associated with your GitHub. Ensure you leave the quotes surrounding your email.

```bash
git config --global credential.helper "/mnt/c/Program\\ Files/Git/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-credential-manager-core.exe"
```

Now any git operation you perform within Ubuntu will use the credential manager.

![As shown here you can use `git config --global user.name` to check your stored username and `git config global user.email` to check your stored email.](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%2012.png)

As shown here you can use `git config --global user.name` to check your stored username and `git config global user.email` to check your stored email.

Set the default branch name to main with this command:

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

Set the default git editor to VS Code with this command:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

and finally turn off rebasing as the default behavior when making a pull:

```bash
git config --global pull.rebase false
```

## Configuring a Global Git Ignore File

<aside>
üö® ***Note: This step is vital to you getting a job after the course. If you do not complete these steps exactly, it will look extremely bad to a future employer when they look over your GitHub repos.***

</aside>

Proper code, utilities, and the use of Git ignore files prevent us from uploading private secrets to the public internet.

A global Git ignore file will prevent us from uploading private secrets to the public internet across all of your projects so that you don't have to worry about making the appropriate entries in every project's Git ignore.

Return to Ubuntu and use this command to create a `.gitignore_global` file in the user directory:

```bash
touch ~/.gitignore_global
```

Next, configure Git to use this file:

```bash
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

Open the new .gitignore_global file in VS Code:

```bash
code ~/.gitignore_global
```

![Creating and opening `~/.gitignore_global` in VS Code](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%2013.png)

The end of the new `.gitignore_global` file.

<aside>
üí° This is a great time to turn on **Auto Save** as well! This setting is in the **File** menu - select it, then re-open the **File** menu to ensure that there is a check mark next to the A**uto Save** option.

</aside>

This should save the file but make sure it gets saved by also manually saving, either by using `Save` in the `File` Menu or by pressing `Ctrl + s`. 

You can close VS Code for now.

![Auto Save with a check next to the option, indicating that it is turned on.](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%2016.png)

# Github

[Github](https://github.com/) provides a way to host Git repos in the cloud. It enables collaboration and is wildly popular. If you have not already created an account there, do so now.

## GitHub CLI

We'll be using the GitHub command line utility to perform some actions on GitHub as well. Install it with this command:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key C99B11DEB97541F0
sudo apt-add-repository https://cli.github.com/packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

Then login with this command:

```bash
gh auth login
```

You will be prompted to login to a github.com account or a GitHub Enterprise account. Select the **github.com** option.
A second prompt will appear asking how you would like to authenticate. Select the **Login with a web browser** option.

You will then be prompted to copy the one time code from the terminal. Do this now. Then press the **Enter** key to open the github.com login page in your browser.

Complete the login process, authorize the GitHub CLI, and return to your terminal. If you were successful, you will receive a message that says authentication is complete. Press **Enter**.

The final prompt will ask you to choose whether you want to use HTTPS or SSH. Select the **HTTPS** option.

![The `gh auth login` process.](Day%201%20-%20macOS%20for%20Intel%20Macs%20011af9d0c1894af5a609bc4e3ff027da/Screen_Shot_2021-02-10_at_9.42.06_PM.png)

The `gh auth login` process.

<aside>
üß† If you are given the option to Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials, do so - this allows you to skip the next step: *Generating a GitHub Personal Access Token.*

</aside>

## Generating a GitHub Personal Access Token

GitHub is deprecating the use of password authentication via the command line starting on August 13, 2021, as detailed in [this GitHub blog post](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/). To prepare for this change, we will be authenticating using GitHub's preferred authentication method: Personal Access Tokens (PATs).

First, visit [https://github.com](https://github.com) and ensure that you are signed in. Also, ensure that you have [verified your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/verifying-your-email-address) with GitHub. After doing so, navigate to [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

On the **Personal access tokens** page, click **Generate new token**.

![The **Personal access tokens** page in **Developer Settings**. The **Generate new token** button is highlighted.](Day%201%20-%20macOS%20for%20Intel%20Macs%20011af9d0c1894af5a609bc4e3ff027da/Untitled%201.png)

The **Personal access tokens** page in **Developer Settings**. The **Generate new token** button is highlighted.

You will be taken to a page prompting you to create a **new personal access token**. Fill the **Note** field with the name of the device you are using the token with. Select all the **repo** scopes - ensure your selections match what is in the screenshot below. When you have done so, click the **Generate token** button.

![Day%201%20-%20macOS%20for%20Intel%20Macs%20011af9d0c1894af5a609bc4e3ff027da/Untitled%202.png](Day%201%20-%20macOS%20for%20Intel%20Macs%20011af9d0c1894af5a609bc4e3ff027da/Untitled%202.png)

You will be taken back to the **Personal access tokens** page, and the token you just created will be visible:

![Day%201%20-%20macOS%20for%20Intel%20Macs%20011af9d0c1894af5a609bc4e3ff027da/Untitled%203.png](Day%201%20-%20macOS%20for%20Intel%20Macs%20011af9d0c1894af5a609bc4e3ff027da/Untitled%203.png)

Click the clipboard button to copy the newly created token.

<aside>
üö® You will only see the token on this page ***ONCE***. You ***MUST*** copy it now and paste it in a secure and private place (preferably in a password manager). Treat this PAT as you would a password! The PAT will be used in place of a password to interact will GitHub on the command line!

</aside>

<aside>
üß† Using multiple machines? It is best practice to create a new PAT for each device requiring command-line access to GitHub - this way, if you need to revoke access to any single device, none of your other devices are impacted.

</aside>

***Place the token in a secure place!***

# So much done! Just a little more now...

<aside>
üö® Although all the files you have stored in Windows are available on the Ubuntu side in `/mnt/c`, accessing them comes at a significant performance cost. Therefore the code you write will be stored in the Ubuntu storage space.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° The Ubuntu storage space can be accessed from Windows at: `\\wsl$\Ubuntu-20.04\`.

</aside>

You shouldn't really have to bring files from Windows to Ubuntu or from Ubuntu to Windows often, but if you see this being an issue, you can use a service like Dropbox to help manage this work for you. As a bonus you'll be able to easily bring files into Ubuntu from other machines and visa-versa as well. 

### Optional: Follow the Dropbox Headless Install via command line instructions found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/install-linux).

# Windows Terminal

Head to the Microsoft Store app again and get, then Install [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

Now when you want to interact directly with Ubuntu you can do so from within the Windows Terminal.

Launch Windows Terminal. It will initially launch with only a Windows PowerShell tab but you can add a Ubuntu 20.04 LTS tab with the dropdown arrow in the title bar.

![Select Ubuntu-20.04 to start an Ubuntu terminal session.](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%2017.png)

Select Ubuntu-20.04 to start an Ubuntu terminal session.

Your session may start in the Windows home directory. If this is the case press `ctrl + ,` on your keyboard to launch the Windows Terminal settings (or access settings from the drop down menu).

Find the Ubuntu-20.04 profile. Add a comma to the end of the last line and add a new line with this content:

```json
"commandline" : "wsl.exe ~"
```

The profiles list with the new line added to the Ubuntu-20.04 profile

You can also make the default profile the Ubuntu-20.04 profile by copying the guid of the Ubuntu profile (`{07b52e3e-de2c-5db4-bd2d-ba144ed6c273}` above, but yours will be different) and replace the existing `defaultProfile`.

![`{07b52e3e-de2c-5db4-bd2d-ba144ed6c273}` is now the default profile](Day%201%20-%20WSL%202%200d42407a4b1e4bb0b9f6b7e8155c10cd/Untitled%2019.png)

`{07b52e3e-de2c-5db4-bd2d-ba144ed6c273}` is now the default profile

As of February 5, 2021 multiple default profiles cannot be specified here, but it is an active feature request with broad support [here](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/756).

If you don't have it open already, launch the Windows Terminal and pin it to your task bar. From now on you will launch Ubuntu from here.

# Node.js

Use this command to install nvm which we will use to install node:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
```

The enter this command block, which will append the nvm directory to your **~/.zshrc** file: 

```bash
cat << EOF >> ~/.zshrc

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" # This loads nvm bash_completion
EOF
```

After doing so, restart the terminal session, and run the `nvm --version` command once more. If you still do not get a version number, alert your instructor.

Restart the terminal session.

Use nvm to install node with this command:

```bash
nvm install node
```

With node installed install nodemon globally with this command:

```bash
npm i -g nodemon
```

# Being More Productive By Using the Keyboard Instead of the Mouse in Windows

## Launching Apps with Search

Developers avoid using the mouse whenever possible because they are more productive when their hands are on the keyboard. Windows lets us do this by opening applications using *Search* instead of the mouse by:

1. Pressing `Windows Key` to open *Search*
2. Start typing the name of the app until the app is highlighted
3. Press `Enter` to open the app!

<aside>
üí° PowerToys includes a macOS-like launcher as well that you can access by pressing `Alt` + `Space`

</aside>

## Switching Between Applications

Quickly switch between running applications by pressing `Alt` + `Tab`.

<aside>
üí° Note that it's best to minimize how many windows/applications you have open when developing to make switching between applications quicker and minimize distractions to the job at hand.

# Taking Screenshots

You'll periodically need to take screenshots. Use `Windows Key` + `Shift` + `s` to take a screenshot of an area of your screen. If you have it you can also use `Prt Sc` to take a screenshot of your entire screen.

The screenshot you take will be placed on your clipboard, and you can paste it wherever you would like to use it.

## Uploading Screenshots and Images to [imgur](https://imgur.com/)

Often you will need to share images with others or use them in your applications, notes, readme files, etc. Unfortunately, if an image exists only on your computer, you lose the ability to use it anywhere but on your computer. To get around this, we can upload images to a cloud service like imgur, one of the most popular image hosting services on the internet. 

Feel free to open an account there, so you can keep track of what you upload, but you can also use their service without an account.

# OH WOW YOU DID IT!

You now are set up to start developing in Linux on Windows! Be very proud of yourself, that was quite the process!

## A Password Manager

While this is optional, we recommend using a password manager to help keep track of the various accounts and logins you will be creating throughout the course and in the rest of your digital life. [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is free, open-source, and provides a great user experience, but if you're using a different one (or not using one at all), that is no problem.
